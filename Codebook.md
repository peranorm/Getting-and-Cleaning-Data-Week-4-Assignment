# Tidy data set description

## Structure of the tidy data set:
Tidy data contains of 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.
Only the variables estimated from mean and std. dev. in the tidy data were kept.

The data were averaged/grouped by subject and activity group. Subject column is numbered from 1 to 30. 
Activity column has 6 categories:
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

## The tidy data consist of 6 rows (averaged based on activity) and 68 columns (66 variables and activity labels).
